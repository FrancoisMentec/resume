I created this resume using HTML and CSS, with a touch of JavaScript to facilitate multilingual support. The design is optimized for print, ensuring it neatly fits on a single A4 sheet.

Feel free to re-use my code for your own resume, but if you choose to do so, either fork this repository directly or provide proper credit to acknowledge its source.
